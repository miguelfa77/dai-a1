In her first stream, focusing on employee compensation, she is particularly interested in developing our understanding around controversies with respect to pay structure (e.g., pay dispersion, pay disparities), organizational structure (e.g., hierarchies, task interdependence, autonomy), and employee attitudes (e.g., fairness, engagement). She studies peer-based compensation in self-managed organizations, whether pro-equality laws reduce gender pay gap, the impact of pay transparency on motivational climate, among others. Her work in this area has been published in many books and journals such as <em>Strategic Management Journal</em>, <em>Human Resource Management, Human Relations, Organization Studies, Journal of Occupational and Organizational and Psychology</em>. One of her papers, “Perceptions of politics and fairness in merit pay“ received the Emerald Literati Network Award for Excellence.</p><p>Prof Tenhiala has another, emerging stream of research.
