      "1.  **The cause of vanishing gradients:** While they mention the effect, they don't explain *why* it happens. This is typically due to the repeated multiplication of small gradients (often less than 1) during backpropagation, especially in deep networks or recurrent connections. Activation functions like sigmoid or tanh, when their inputs are saturated, also contribute significantly by having very small derivatives.\n",
      "2.  **The consequences:** Beyond slow learning, vanishing gradients can lead to the earlier layers of a network learning very little, effectively making the network unable to capture complex, long-range dependencies (especially relevant for RNNs).\n",
      "3.  **Mention of Exploding Gradients:** Vanishing gradients are often discussed alongside their opposite, exploding gradients, which is also a common problem in deep learning training.\n",
